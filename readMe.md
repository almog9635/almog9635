my project is about encrypting files or folders using an input output or via a config file using json. My project is useful to protect files from being seen by unnecessary or harmful people who can see the information. For using the config file there is an example down below.





example for config file that encrypt a folder using caesar encryption and doing 5 iterations of it:
{
    "encrypt": false,
    "path" : "C:\\Users\\idoma\\Desktop\\almog yd\\projects\\TypeScript\\src\\texts-encrypted",
    "format": "caesar",
    "iterations": "5"
}
